I'm a software developer who is enthusiastic about accessibility in technology and its power to make the impossible seem simple for everyone!

## Learner 👨‍🏫 and Problem Solver 🧐
I consider myself a problem solver first and foremost, who can take that mindset to tackle and learn new systems, languages, and frameworks at a fast pace. My experience at Prime Digital Academy has positioned me to apply that learning process to anything new at a rapid pace, and to quickly apply newfound skills.

## Kindness 💜, Passion 🔥, and Eccentricity 🤪
Seeking to apply compassion and kindness in code and my personal life. I firmly believe in the difference between being nice (often fraudulent) and being a good person, and seek to be the latter in all my practices in life. Furthermore, I'm a self-described weirdo and enjoy being myself and expressing who I am, being fun to work with, and encouraging others to do the same.

## Technology ⌨️ and Accessibility 🌎
Technology has the power to make the world more accessible to everyone, and I firmly want to be a part of that process. I seek interesting opportunities to expand my world views, improve myself, and become the software engineer that I would be proud to show everyone I am.
